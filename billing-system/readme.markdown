Requirements
---

Here's how they describe what they want:

    There will be a MongoDB Database which will be storing Billing information with the following attributes:
    - non-Integer UID
    - Amount (Float)
    - List of Comments
    - List of Tags
    - List of attached Documents (by document UID, you won't have to worry about that)

    Furthermore, this "Billing Information" object needs to be reflected in a Node.JS object with CRUD methods for:
    -  Comments
    -  Tags
    -  Documents (by  UID)

    * Module + Tests are sufficient for now, the UI can wait a bit.

    * It's (MongoDB library) your choice.
