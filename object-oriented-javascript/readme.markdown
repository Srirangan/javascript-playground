A collection of object oriented programming implementations in JavaScript.

Classes and Objects
---

* In JavaScript, all functions can be instantiated, hence all functions can be used as classes
    * Anonymous functions can also be used as classes
    * Instance member function can also be used as classes
* Function (being used as a class) is also its own constructor
* Static (class) members can be defined outside the function body
* Instance members are attached to the prototype
    * Instance members can be defined outside the function body
* Inheritence is achieved by setting prototypes
* Parent class constructors must me explicitly called
* Instanceof operator can be used to check type of an object
