=====

A higher order function forEach is created which takes two parameters:

* a list
* a function that is to operate on each list item

Two examples of forEach's usage:

* first case involves passing a list listOfThings and a predefined function logItem
    * logItem is called for each item in listOfThings
* second case is similar except an anonymous function is created and passed instead of logItem
    * the anonymous function is called for each item in anotherListOfThings
